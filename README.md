This War Thunder localization is meant to standardize the vehicle, weapon/ammo, camouflage and some decal names as well as make corrections where needed.

Installation:
1. Go to your War Thunder directory (E.G. SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\War Thunder)
2. Open config.blk with your text editor of choice
3. Add "testLocalization:b=yes" to the code block named "debug" and save the file
4. Start your game to get the folder named "lang" to appear
5. Extract this localization into the "lang" folder
6. Either switch languages to a different language and back again or reboot your game
7. If LLM appears in the top left below the online players count, it worked. If not, check if all steps were followed correctly.
